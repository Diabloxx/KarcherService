This project is a Vite + React dashboard for Karcher Service Orders. Use modern, clean UI components and charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts). Mock data should represent service orders with statuses: New, Finished, Submitted, Waiting for Parts. Visualize order status flow, daily completions, and estimated wait times.
